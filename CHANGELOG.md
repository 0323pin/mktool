## Version 1.3.0 (2024-10-01)

 * check-portability: Add new "mktool check-portability" command.  Runs 30x
   faster than the shell version in x11/qt5-qtwebengine on a MacBook Pro M1.
   Does not yet support `CHECK_PORTABILITY_EXPERIMENTAL=yes`.

## Version 1.2.0 (2024-09-20)

 * check-shlibs: Add new "mktool check-shlibs" command.  Should behave the

 * Minor cleanups to checksum, distinfo, and fetch.

## Version 1.0.1 (2024-09-13)
